# Shark-Attack-Research
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE FOR THIS RESEARCH

The objective of this research is to improve our understanding of the presence of sharks during tourist seasons in middle Atlantic and south eastern coastal waters, specifically North Carolina and South Carolina. Our study will focus on the analysis of existing data from the International Shark Attack database, weather and water data from NOAA, calculated moon phase dates, crab and turtle populations. The quantitative analysis on this data will lead to new and interesting knowledge that will provide the basis for an app providing advanced information on the likelihood of sharks in coastal waters where tourists swim, surf and wade.

An additional focus of this research is to analyze social media activity relative to shark presence. Tweets will be mined with specific data ranges and locations in order to assess social media activity with respect to shark sightings, attacks, and even activities that are related to shark presence such as schools of fish. Once the nature of this activity is understood, a standardized way to tweet will be promoted with interested and strategic partners in order to ultimately provide an additional feed to the app described above.

Final Data Sets are provided. Raw data is not always provided due to sensitive nature of some of the data that we have analyzed. Thank you to the following individuals and organizations for providing data and/or support for the project:
